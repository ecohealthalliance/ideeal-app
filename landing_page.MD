## Overview  
The IDEEAL project looks at the tradeoffs between human-environmental health and economic growth from palm oil production. 

Every time a hectare of land is allocated for palm oil production there are both benefits and costs. Palm oil production can increase peopleâ€™s quality of life through the creation of more jobs and infrastructure and the 

However, the development of that same hectare of land also generates social costs from a reduction in ecosystem services (e.g. food, disease regulation, carbon storage, biodiversity, water retention) and an increase in negative externalities (e.g. soil erosion and water pollution\footnote{Sharp et al. 2016}). Land use change is the leading cause of infectious disease emergence, which can generate costs in the billions of dollars.

### Why an economic model?
- Making the decision to develop or conserve each hectar of land requires an understanding of the inherent tradeoffs being made through that decision.
- An economic model allows us to quantitatively assess these trade-offs to inform policy making and land use planning. It can provide answers to the following questions:
  + How much and at what rate should land be cleared for development?
  + What land should be conserved?
  + Where can land be developed to minimize health impacts while maximizing economic benefits?
  + How does much does considering the value of ecosystems services, especially that of disease regulation, change the optimal level of developemnt.

### What does this app do?
This app calculates the expected damages to society from disease outbreaks that would occur if the ecosystem was converted. It outputs the socially optimal amount of land to be developed for palm oil.
