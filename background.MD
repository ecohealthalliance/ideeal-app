## Overview  
IDEEAL looks at the tradeoffs between human-environmental health and economic growth due to palm oil production.

Why an economic model?
- Land development or conservation requires to understand the tradeoffs between what we are gaining and losing from development. The same goes for conservation. We need to understand what we are gaining and losing from conserving ecosystems. 
- An economic model allows us to assess these trade-offs to inform decision/policy making for land development. It can provide insight on:
How much, at what rate and where to clear land for development minimizing health impacts while maximizing economic benefits

## What does this app do?
Calculate the expected damages to society from disease outbreaks that would occur if the ecosystem was converted

## Project Goals
1. Build models of land-use change and economics of disease emergence that can be used by local and regional decision makers;
2. Describe the relationship between disease emergence, land-use change, and human behavior, and quantify an ecosystem's disease regulating value;
3. Build toolkits and establish a center of excellence to develop and promote best practices, research, and reduced-impact land use guidance; and
4. Engage private companies and educate and empower civil society stakeholders to work together for a healthy and sustainable future.
