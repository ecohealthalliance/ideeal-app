## Scenario Analysis

The set up of the dynamic optimization model makes it possible to generalize the model to any spatial scale, from a private land holding up to the country or regional level. We have included two full case studies, a state-level study of Sabah, Malaysia, and country-level study for Thailand. You can work through the case studies in the tabs labeled with the study location at the top of this page.  These case studies demonstrates how a consideration of the social costs of land conversion, especially declines in the disease regulation and carbon storage capacity of land, can change the optimal amount of land for conversion through time.

It can be difficult to guess the appropriate parameter values for areas where detailed information on ecosystem services and infection rates is not readily available. Therefore, we recommend starting with one of the scenarios and then adjusting the parameter values to your area of interest in the **Detailed Variable Control** tab. Site-specific values are not available for all parameters in all locations, so we have provided a chart on each location's page showing which values are specific to the location, which are the default values, and where each value came from. 

If you are interested in palm oil production in Africa specifically, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has put together a report with all relevant information [here](http://www.fao.org/DOCrEP/005/Y4355E/y4355e00.htm#Contents).
