## Scenario Analysis

The set up of the dynamic optimization model makes it possible to generalize the model to an spatial scale, from a private land holding up to the country or regional level. We have included two case studies, a state-level study of Sabah, Malaysia, and country-level study for Thailand. You can work through case studies in the tabs labeled **Sabah** and **Thailand**.

It can be difficult to guess the appropriate parameter values for areas where detailed information on ecosystem services and infection rates is not readily available. Therefore, we recommend starting with one of the scenarios and then adjusting the parameter values to your area of interest in the **Detailed Variable Control** tab.
