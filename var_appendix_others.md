[Discount rates](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-are-social-discount-rates/) are used to convert future economic value into present economic value. For example, people receive benefits from forests in the form of ecosystem services provided over the course of a year.  When calculating the overall value of that forest, planners should consider not just the value it provides in that year, but the value it will provide into the future. Discount rates help us convert that value distributed across time into "Net Present Value," so that the benefits of a resource for future generations is integrated into its worth. Similarly, palm oil plantations provide a source of income through time from the continuous production of a product. As such, discount rates are used for both private and public goods.

Converting forest into a planation can be cost intensive and substantially impact how and where land conversion is performed. BUrning, though illegal in some places (such as Indonesia), is often the cheapest way to clear land. However, the [health costs of haze](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-researchers-peat-burning-sumatra-causes-severe-haze-singapore-1121) in the surrounding region can be quite high.  This parameter gives the cost of transition from forest to agriculture for a hectare of land in USD

#### <span style="color:#20642E"><b>Total population in the region</b></span>

The total population in the region of interest affects the model because of the relationship between human population and disease. In areas with both high populations and land conversion rates, disease rates and associated costs are much higher.
