## Disease and Land Use Change in Thailand

Thailand produces 3% of the world's palm oil and is currently ranked as its third largest producer, after Indonesia and Malaysia. Since 2010, Thailand's production of palm oil has doubled, leading to concerns about land clearing for oil palm plantations and production expansion into carbon-rich peatland areas. In 2015, the area planted for palm oil totalled 4,400,589 rai (704,094 hectares), an increase of 6% from the previous year (Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE)). Most of this expansion has occured in the southern part of the country, where 85% of plantations by area are located.

Thailand differs from Indonesia and Malaysia in that the growing of oil palms is done mostly by small landholders who farm plantations of 20 rai (3.2 hectares) or smaller (Krungsri Research). Thailand is home to 200,000 small-scale oil palm growers which make up more than 70% of total production (Mongabay). Because of the localized scale of production, Thailand, on average, has higher production costs than the agricultural conglomerates of Malaysia and Indonesia and a slightly slower per hectare yield.
