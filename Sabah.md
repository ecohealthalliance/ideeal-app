## Land Conversion and Malaria in Sabah

#### The state of Sabah, located in Malaysian Borneo, has both high levels of biodviersity and high rates of deforestation. Between 1973 and 2010, 40% of Sabah's total forest area was converted from forest to cropland, more than half of which was allocated to the production of oil palm (Gaveau et al. 2014).  This process has been linked to malaria infection rates and costly disease prevention and control efforts.  More land conversion from forest to plantation is planned to meet projected increases in human population and global demand for palm oil products over the next decade.

#### Futhermore, land conversion in Sabah has caused a total loss in the Net Present Value (value of something from the present and into the future) of carbon stored in a hectare of land. This corresponds to a decrease in value derived from forest-provided ecosystem services, such as water and air purification and protection against extreme weather events.

## Parameter Values
#### This case study demonstrates how a consideration of the social costs of land conversion, especially declines in the disease regulation and carbon storage capacity of land, can change the optimal amount of land for conversion through time. 

Here are the parameter values:
