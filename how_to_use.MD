## How to Use this App

* The app allows you to explore the effect of palm oil production on human-environmental health and economic growth.


* It is recommended for you to start with the <b>Overview</b> page, which allows you to understand the project context. Next, we recommend you play around with the key variable inputs on the <b>Model Key Inputs and Results</b> tab to help build intuition about how changes in these values affect the optimal land conversion rate.


* If you are interested, there are more detailed variables that can be used as inputs for the model, which can be explored under the <b>Model Input Variables</b> tab. These include detailed descriptions of ecosystem services, types of land holders, and input costs. Description of these variables and links to parameter estimates can be found under the <b>Variable Appendix</b> tab. 


* Also included are ____ scenarios that can used as baseline examples from which to customize model inputs. These scenarios include models and parameter values for Sabah, Malaysia and the country of Thailand. They provide a guideline for how this app can be used.
